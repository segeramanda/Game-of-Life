# Game-of-Life

In this individual project, the algorithm to implement was chosen to be Game of life. The game of life, invented by John Horton Conway in 1970, is a cellular automaton. Meaning that, firstly a grid consisting of cells is created and then for each cell, the neighbourhood is determined and according to some rules, a new generation is created. The main purpose of this project is to make the code as efficient as possible, using optimization tools and parallelization.

The code is compiled using the command make
Then run the code using ./golmp generations height width,
where generations is an integer of the number of rounds, height is an integer of the number of rows and width an integer of the number of columns.
